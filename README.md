# IoT Based Plant Monitoring System

## Introduction
The IoT Based Plant Monitoring System is a project that aims to automate the process of monitoring the water level in the soil of plants and watering them accordingly. This system is designed to ensure that plants receive adequate water supply and are not over-watered.

## Components Used
- ESP32 Development Board
- Soil Moisture Sensor
- Water Pump
- OLED Display
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard

## Functionality
The system uses an ESP32 development board to read data from the soil moisture sensor, which detects the water level in the soil of the plant. The data is then displayed on the OLED display and ThingSpeak platform. If the water level is below a certain threshold, the system activates the water pump to water the plant. This ensures that the plant is not over-watered and receives the appropriate amount of water.

## Usage
To use the IoT Based Plant Monitoring System, connect the components to the pins defined. Upload the code to the ESP32 development board and power on the system.Make required changes in header file for internet connectivity. The OLED display will show the water level in the soil of the plant, and the water pump will automatically water the plant if the water level is below the specified threshold.

## Conclusion
The IoT Based Plant Monitoring System is an easy-to-use and affordable solution for automating the process of monitoring and watering plants. It helps to ensure that plants receive adequate water supply and are not over-watered, which can lead to their death. This system is a great way to keep your plants healthy and thriving.
